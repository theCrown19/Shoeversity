# Shoeversity
Made by a begginer for school using HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT JQUERY PHP and mySQL.

Incase you want to use this for any reason..

1. Configure all PHP and mySQL connection
2. Shoeversity products.php only supports 2 images for shop. Replace the png for those shop logos if you want to link other sites
4. The filter is not flexible. it is only for 4 brands and when you add one you need to configure the jquery...
3. To add more products goto products.php and click the @2022 Shoeversity at the footer 5 times the password are wow123 and 123wow (you can change them)
